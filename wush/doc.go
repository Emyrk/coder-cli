// Package wush is Coder Enterprise's protocol for transmitting Linux command execution
// over a WebSocket connection. It provides stdin, stdout, tty information, and exit code.
//
// This package provides the protocol, but no facilities beyond that for creating a wush server.
// This protocol was designed haphazardly and will likely be rebuild in the near term.
